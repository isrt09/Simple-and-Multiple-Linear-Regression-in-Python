# Linear-Regression-in-Python-Using-Scikit-Learn-StatsModels-and-TensorFlow
  - A researcher is often interested in using sample data to investigate relationships, with an ultimate goal of creating a model to predict a future value for some dependent variable. The process of finding this mathematical model that best fits the data involves regression analysis.

  Linear regression that emphasizes data analysis and interpretation. Generally, statistical regression is collection of methods for determining and using models that explain how a response variable (dependent variable) relates to one or more explanatory variables (predictor variables).
